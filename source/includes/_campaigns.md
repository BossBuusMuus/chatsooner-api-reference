# Campaigns

We bring you the ability to run super chargedâš¡ WhatsApp campaigns through chatinc's Campaigns API. 

This API allows developers to focus solely on the conversational experience they wish to provide their users without having to focus on WhatsApp's core API or ever be exposed to it, allowing faster development cycles and happier teamsðŸ˜„  

## Campaigns in general

**Campaigns** involve sending informative broadcasts to users, expecting them to take certain actions and receiving certain feedback. There's a lot you can do with the Campaigns API. By combining a few special components together mainly the Campaigns API itself, [Bot Builder](#flows) APIs, and [Catalog](#catalog) APIs you can generate any number of possibilities for your campaigns.
