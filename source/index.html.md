# Welcome (v0.7.9)

Welcome to the **Chat Inc API Reference Documentation**. Easily build and launch conversational experiences from the ground up or embed them into your existing infrastructure with fast, secure and scalable APIsðŸ˜‰. 

Feel free to look around and see what you can achieve. This is a living documentðŸ› , likely to be updated everydayðŸ˜„. 

To get your own API keys go to [chatinc](https://chatinc.com) and create an account. A sandbox is a also available.


# Getting Started

> To authorize, use this code:


```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "https://api.chatinc.com/end_point"
  -H "Authorization: [Your API Key]"
```

```javascript
//No javascript library available for this endpoint. Use curl instead
```

Some endpoints have usage limits whilst in sandbox. Please visit our [FAQ](https://chatinc.com) page for more details.
 
We expect the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: [Your API Key]`
